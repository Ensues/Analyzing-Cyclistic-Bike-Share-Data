A Capstone Project for Google Data Analytics Certification

**May 31, 2025**

**Presented By:** Quiambao, Eric Janssen P.

## Project Overview
This project examines Cyclistic’s bike-share data to uncover behavioral differences between annual members (Subscribers) and casual riders (Customers). 

Using a full 12-month dataset, I analyzed seasonal trends and usage patterns through Google Sheets, Tableau Public, and Google BigQuery (SQL). 

The insights derived—such as Customers taking longer, weekend-centric rides and Subscribers riding more frequently during weekdays—form the basis for targeted digital marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into loyal annual members.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Google Sheets** - For data cleaning, manipulation, and initial pivot table analysis.
- **Tableau Public** - To create interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Google BigQuery (SQL)** - For efficient data querying and aggregation.

*Note: R integration was planned for future analysis but is not included in the current project scope.*

## Repository Structure
- **Data** - Raw and cleaned datasets.
- **SQL** - BigQuery queries and output results.
- **Visualizations** - Tableau Public dashboard link and screenshots.
- **Documentation** - Detailed project documentation and analysis summaries.
