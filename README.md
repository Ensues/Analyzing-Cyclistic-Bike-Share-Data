## Project Overview
This project examines Cyclistic’s bike-share data to uncover behavioral differences between annual members (Subscribers) and casual riders (Customers). 

Using a full 12-month dataset, I analyzed seasonal trends and usage patterns through Google Sheets, Tableau Public, and Google BigQuery (SQL). 

The insights derived—such as Customers taking longer, weekend-centric rides and Subscribers riding more frequently during weekdays—form the basis for targeted digital marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into loyal annual members.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Google Sheets** - For data cleaning, manipulation, and initial pivot table analysis.
- **Tableau Public** - To create interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Google BigQuery (SQL)** - For efficient data querying and aggregation.

*Note: R integration was planned for future analysis but is not included in the current project scope.*

## Repository Structure
- **Data** - Raw and cleaned datasets.
- **SQL** - BigQuery queries and output results.
- **Visualizations** - Tableau Public dashboard link and screenshots.
- **Documentation** - Detailed project documentation and analysis summaries.

## Methodology Summary

The project follows a structured six-phase data analytics process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
- **Ask** - Define business questions and objectives.
- **Prepare** - Gather and clean a 12-month dataset with key fields (e.g., start_time, ride_length, user_type, etc.).
- **Process** - Transform data in Google Sheets, create pivot tables and charts, and remove unnecessary columns.
- **Analyze** - Use pivot tables in Sheets, interactive dashboards in Tableau Public, and SQL queries in BigQuery to uncover behavioral differences between Subscribers and Customers.
- **Share** - Publish findings via an interactive Tableau dashboard and detailed GitHub documentation.
- **Act** - Develop targeted marketing recommendations based on the analysis.

## Key Findings & Insights

- **Ride Duration** - Customers average longer ride durations (approximately 27–33 minutes) compared to Subscribers (around 11–13 minutes).
- **Usage Patterns** - Subscribers have higher ride counts on weekdays, indicating commuter usage, while Customers show peak activity on weekends.
- **Time-of-Day Trends** - Subscribers tend to ride during early and late working hours, consistent with typical commutes, whereas Customers ride more consistently throughout the day with a notable surge on weekends.

These insights form a robust foundation for developing targeted digital marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into loyal annual members.
